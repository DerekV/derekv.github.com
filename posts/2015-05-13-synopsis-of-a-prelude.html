<h1 id="what-are-we-doing-here">What are we doing here?</h1>
<p>Sometimes, I like to walk and try not to think about where I am going. Exploring, I guess. Eventually I get to a place, and I stand, wait, breath, and just experience being there. I do not try to make the place be anything, I don’t ask anything out of it.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what this site will become. Right now, I just have a notion that I want to have a site to publicly post ideas. Well, the internet is as good a place as any to start, I suppose. The weather is cool and overcast, there is a breeze, it perfect weather for this type of exploring. I guess I’ll start walking, and let this site become.</p>
